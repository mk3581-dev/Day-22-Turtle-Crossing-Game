🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

A fun arcade-style road crossing game built using Python and the Turtle graphics module as part of Day 23 of Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code – Python Bootcamp.

The objective is simple:
Help the turtle cross the road without getting hit by moving cars. Each successful crossing increases the level and makes the game harder!

🎮 Game Preview

The player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy road filled with moving cars.
Every time the turtle reaches the top safely, the level increases and the cars move faster.

🚀 Features

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structure

Smooth game loop using screen.tracer()

Randomly generated cars

Collision detection

Level progression system

Increasing difficulty

Game Over screen

🧠 Concepts Used

Classes and Objects

Inheritance

Game loop logic

Event listeners (onkey)

Collision detection using distance

Modular programming (multi-file structure)

🕹️ How to Play

Run the program:

python main.py


Controls:

Press Up Arrow (↑) to move the turtle forward.

Avoid the cars and reach the top of the screen to level up!

📦 Requirements

Python 3.x

Built-in turtle module (comes with standard Python installation)

📈 Difficulty Scaling

Each time the turtle successfully crosses the road:

The level increases

Car speed increases

The game becomes more challenging

🏆 Learning Outcome

This project strengthens understanding of:

Object-Oriented Programming in Python

Managing multiple classes

Game logic implementation

Writing clean and modular code
